# Fraud-Detection

In this project, 4 algorithms have been compared for Fraud Detection
The algorithms used are:
- Random Forest Classifier
- Decision Tree
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Classifier
These algorithms have been compared on basis of different performance metrics like Accuracy Score, Precision Score, F1 score and Recall Score
